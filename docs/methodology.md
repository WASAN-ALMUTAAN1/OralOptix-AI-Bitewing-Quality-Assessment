# Methodology

## Selected Methodology
The project follows the **Iterative Waterfall Model**.

This methodology is similar to the traditional waterfall model and includes five sequential stages:

1. Requirement Analysis  
2. Design  
3. Implementation  
4. Verification  
5. Maintenance  

## Why Iterative Waterfall?
Unlike the standard waterfall model, the iterative waterfall approach provides flexibility by allowing revisits to earlier stages when changes or updates are needed.

This helps the project team to:
- Detect issues earlier
- Improve risk management
- Enhance quality assurance

## Development Flow
Although the process allows iteration, the stages themselves are structured and non-overlapping, meaning each stage starts and ends before moving to the next one.
