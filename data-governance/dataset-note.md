# Dataset Note

## Overview
This project (OralOptix) was developed as an academic AI-based prototype for the intelligent assessment of intra-oral radiograph quality, with a focus on bitewing radiographic images.

The repository presents the **project structure, interface, workflow, and reporting outputs**, while intentionally limiting public access to any sensitive or restricted data components.

## Dataset Availability in This Repository
The full training and evaluation dataset is **not publicly distributed** in this repository.

This decision is intentional and based on:
- Privacy protection
- Ethical considerations in healthcare AI
- Institutional and academic data governance requirements
- Responsible sharing practices for medical imaging projects

## Demonstration Data and Screenshots
Any names, IDs, report values, or patient-related details shown in screenshots, UI examples, or generated reports in this repository are:
- **Demonstration-only**
- **Non-clinical examples**
- **Not real patient records**
- Used strictly for illustrating interface flow and report formatting

## Data Sensitivity and Medical Context
Because the project relates to medical imaging and healthcare workflows, dataset handling must be treated with elevated caution. Public repositories are not appropriate for sharing:
- Identifiable radiographs
- Raw patient-linked metadata
- Sensitive institutional records
- Clinical identifiers or protected health information

## Reproducibility Note
This repository is designed to document the project academically and visually. It is not intended to function as a full public benchmark package.

Researchers interested in reproducing a similar pipeline may use:
- Publicly available dental imaging datasets (where licensing permits)
- Synthetic or anonymized samples
- Institutionally approved datasets under proper ethical and legal permissions

## Recommended Good Practice for Future Users
If you build upon a similar healthcare AI workflow:
1. Use de-identified data only
2. Obtain institutional permission before using clinical images
3. Document labeling criteria and quality-control standards clearly
4. Separate demo assets from real data
5. Avoid publishing metadata that could re-identify individuals

## Summary
This repository is a **responsibly curated public version** of the project:
- suitable for academic review and portfolio presentation,
- informative for understanding the system design,
- and safe for public sharing.
