# Privacy and Ethics

## Ethical Positioning of the Project
OralOptix is an **academic AI-assisted prototype** developed for the intelligent assessment of intra-oral radiograph quality. The project is positioned as a research and educational system that supports workflow understanding and quality-awareness in radiographic imaging.

It is **not** presented as a replacement for licensed clinical judgment, diagnosis, or professional decision-making.

## Privacy Commitment
This repository follows a privacy-first documentation approach.

### Key Principles
- No real patient-identifiable data is intentionally shared
- Public materials are limited to non-sensitive examples
- Demonstration screenshots are used for interface illustration only
- Sensitive datasets and institutional records are excluded from public release

## Responsible Use of Healthcare AI
AI systems in healthcare can be useful for support, standardization, and workflow improvement, but they must be used responsibly.

This project acknowledges the following:
- AI outputs may be imperfect or context-dependent
- Clinical interpretation requires trained professionals
- Model predictions should be reviewed, not blindly accepted
- Safety, transparency, and accountability are essential

## Intended Use
The materials in this repository are intended for:
- Academic presentation
- Portfolio demonstration
- Educational discussion
- Research communication

They are **not intended for direct clinical deployment** without:
- Proper validation
- Institutional approval
- Regulatory review (where required)
- Ongoing expert oversight

## Ethical Development Considerations
The project was developed with attention to the following ethical dimensions:
- **Privacy**: avoiding disclosure of sensitive medical information
- **Transparency**: clarifying what is demo content vs. real-world functionality
- **Scope control**: defining the project as an academic prototype
- **Safety awareness**: not overstating model capability
- **Respect for clinical practice**: preserving the role of human expertise

## Bias and Limitations Statement
As with all AI and medical imaging systems, performance may vary depending on:
- Image quality
- Data distribution
- Labeling consistency
- Clinical acquisition conditions
- Population and equipment differences

Any future real-world use would require rigorous validation across representative settings.

## Academic Integrity and Attribution
This repository is shared in good faith for educational and academic purposes. Users are expected to:
- Cite the project appropriately
- Avoid misrepresenting demo outputs as clinical evidence
- Respect privacy and ethical boundaries in derivative work

## Final Note
OralOptix reflects a responsible academic effort at the intersection of:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Medical Imaging
- Healthcare Workflow Support

The project prioritizes ethical communication and safe public sharing while demonstrating technical and research value.
