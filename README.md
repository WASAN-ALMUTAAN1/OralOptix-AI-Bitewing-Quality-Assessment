## Overview

**OralOptix** is an academic AI project designed to support the **quality assessment of intra-oral dental radiographs** (especially bitewing images) through an organized workflow and AI-assisted report generation.

The project combines:
- A structured user workflow (upload → patient info → technical settings → AI analysis)
- A patient management interface
- AI-generated radiograph quality reports
- A clean clinical-style report output (PDF-ready format)


---

## Important Notice

> **This repository contains prototype interfaces, academic materials, and demonstration outputs.**  
> **All displayed patient names, IDs, and report data shown in screenshots are demo/test data only (not real patient data).**

This project is shared for **academic, educational, and portfolio purposes**.

## Key Features

### 1) Multi-Step Clinical Workflow
A structured and easy-to-follow workflow for radiograph analysis:

1. Upload radiograph image
2. Select or add patient information
3. Enter technical imaging parameters
4. Generate AI-assisted quality assessment output

---

### 2) Patient Management Module
The interface includes a patient management page that supports:
- Viewing patients
- Searching records
- Adding new patients
- Editing patient details
- Basic UI actions for record management

---

### 3) AI-Generated Report Output
The system generates a radiograph quality assessment report containing:
- Patient metadata
- Radiograph classification (e.g., diagnostic / non-diagnostic)
- Technical imaging parameters
- AI-generated corrective recommendations

---

### 4) Professional Visual Design
The user interface follows a consistent visual identity:
- Clean healthcare-inspired theme
- Strong contrast and readable layout
- Reusable UI components
- Presentation-ready visuals for demos and academic presentations

## Problem and Solution

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/problem-solution-diagram.png" alt="Problem-Solution Diagram" width="80%" />
</p>

**Problem addressed:**  
Manual quality checking of dental radiographs can be inconsistent and time-consuming, and repeated imaging may increase unnecessary radiation exposure.

**OralOptix approach:**  
Provide an AI-assisted workflow to help classify radiograph quality and suggest corrective actions in a structured, report-oriented interface.
